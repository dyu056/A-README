# About Me - Daniel Yu

Hello! I'm an Autonomous Systems Engineer specializing in guidance schemes for both spacecraft and aircraft. My passion lies in the elegance of control theory â€” from crafting optimized controllers to applying these principles to actual vehicles with a blend of artificial intelligence. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD, focusing on guidance schemes for drag-sails, aiming to achieve targeted deorbiting into precise locations.

But my work isn't confined to space. On the ground, I'm delving into the world of GNC for FSAE racecars. To me, control system engineering transcends equations; it's about bringing these concepts to life, optimizing the performance of real vehicles. This exciting journey is not just about numbers and theories; it's a quest to see these ideas in motion, enhancing the capabilities of both terrestrial and extraterrestrial vehicles. My ambission is to build the smartest autonomous vehicles in the world with the best performance possible.

So, if you wish to know more about me, please direct yourself to the Wiki of this repo, where all my projects are listed there :D
